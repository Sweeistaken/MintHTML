ANTIZERO RULES V1 by SweeZero CEO as of 2024 (Swee)

This software is an AntiZero, which means that even though it was made by a SweeZero team member, it only belongs to themself.

The current CEO of SweeZero as of this file was made (Swee) has made a few rules subject to this type of software:
1. The code of this project must be owned by a SweeZero team member in order to be AntiZero.
2. Any code inside an AntiZero type software cannot be used inside any code that will be published under SweeZero.
2.5: It will be recommended to add comments inside your code that indicate AntiZero code.
3. Because AntiZero makes your code belong to YOU and not SweeZero, you can add any graphic/mascot of your program.
